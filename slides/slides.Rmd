## Introduction

In this assignment, I am going to create a random app and a web page presentation to explain what the app is as well as show you how to use this app.

## Project Detail

In this project, I am offering you an EDA app (link to the app provided in the next slide) from the Iris data set. There are 4 features for each Iris: (1) Sepal Length, (2) Sepal Width, (3) Petal Length, and (4) Petal Width. I have already provided an interactive Pair plot for you. You can choose any set of features to perform the EDA process.

**Note**: You must select a sub-set of at least 2 features to make the EDA understandable.
